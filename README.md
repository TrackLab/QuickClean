# Welcome to QuickClean

I'm sure you know that. Your Desktop is overfloded with all sorts of files.
A few MP4 here, a PNG there, an EXE over there and a few more folders that are "ment" to keep it all clean.

I made QuickClean exactly for that purpose. To open a program for 1 second, and immediatley have a clean, sorted Desktop.

## How does it work
QuickClean sorts all the files in the same directory it is in. So if you put QuickClean as EXE or a PY file on the desktop and run it, it will clean the desktop. Put it inside some other folder, it will clean that folders files. Simple as that.

It sorts the files by filetype. For each new filetype, QuickClean will create a new folder that has the name of the file extension.
For a few "known" file extensions, it will name the folders to a more readable format. If the filetype is not "known", the folders name will simply be the extension.

So a ".py" file will go into the folder "PYTHON", a ".EXE" will go into the folder "EXE" and so on.
Preexisting folders and folders in general will be ignored. Only actual files will be sorted.

## Is it dangerous?
No, obviously not, why would it be? I will upload QuickClean as a simple to run .exe that can be run on any Windows machine, as well as the actual code in a .py file. So you can check the code yourself if you like. It really only sorts files, that is all it does.

## What if I have files with the same name in different directorys?
Should you have run QuickClean before, or coincidentally already have a folder that QuickClean intends to use for sorting, and on both "old location" and "new location" you have a file with the same name and extension, QuickClean will add a "(1)" to the new file. Just like Windows does the same.
